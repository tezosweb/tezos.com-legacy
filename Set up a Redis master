Set up a Redis master
In this section, you deploy a Redis master and verify that it is running.

Set up gcloud and kubectl credentials
gcloud container clusters \
    get-credentials [cluster-name] \
    --zone [cluster-zone]
Replace [cluster-name] and [cluster-zone] with the name and zone of the instance that you created.

cat redis-master-deployment.yaml
This file contains configuration to deploy a Redis master. The spec field defines the pod specification that the replication controller uses to create the Redis pod. The image tag refers to a Docker image to be pulled from a registry.

kubectl create -f \
    redis-master-deployment.yaml
