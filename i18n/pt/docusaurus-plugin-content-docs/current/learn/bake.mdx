## Help secure the ledger

“Baking” is the act of signing and publishing blocks to the Tezos blockchain. Bakers are a crucial component of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism by ensuring that all transactions in a block are correct, that the order of transactions is agreed upon, and that no double-spending has occurred.

### Validate Transactions
Bakers validate all transactions and add them to the blockchain. If a baker behaves dishonestly, the protocol has a built-in mechanism that can cause them to lose their security deposit.

### Earn Rewards
Bakers are rewarded with additional tez for securing the network.

### Become a Baker
Request to join the baker chat room if you are building a baking operation. A community member runs the chat room and acts on these requests.
