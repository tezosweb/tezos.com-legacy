## How To Get Started

### 1. Check Your Contribution

Click on the "Check Your Contribution" button below to check the recommended allocation of a given public key hash. Contributors may find their public key hashes on the PDF documents they created during the Foundation's fundraiser.

<Button 
    text="Check Your Contribution"
    href="https://check.tezos.com/"
/>

### 2. Obtain Your Activation Code

Activation codes are required to access the recommended allocations of the corresponding public key hashes. In order to obtain these codes, contributors must complete the Foundation’s Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering (“KYC/AML”) process. Contributors who have not completed this process may do so now.

<Button 
    text="Begin KYC/AML"
    href="https://verification.tezos.com/"
/> <Button
    text="KYC/AML FAQ"
    href="https://tezos.foundation/privacy-notice/"
    inverse />


### 3. Activate Your Recommended Allocation

Recommended allocations from the fundraiser must be activated before they can be accessed. A contributor may activate the recommended allocation of a given public key hash by using the Activation Tool. This tool may also reveal the blinded key of the given public key hash. Blinded keys, not public key hashes, are the keys that appear in the genesis block proposed by the Foundation, which may be found [here](https://tezos.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5223213-genesis.txt).

A balance for a public key hash that was recommended an allocation will not appear on a Tezos block explorer until it has been activated. After a contributor has activated its recommended allocation, it may view the “Store and Use” page for information regarding storing and using its Tezos tokens (“tez”).

    text="Activate"
