## The Basics

Holding Tezos tokens (“tez”) enables one to interact with the Tezos blockchain. There are many wallets with which to store and use tez. Wallets listed below have undergone at least one independent external security audit.

Always remember: **if you do not control your private keys, you do not control your tokens**. Every user should make sure to exercise extreme care and take all available safety precautions when entering private key information anywhere. Any party or software, such as a wallet, that gains knowledge of private key information will have access to the tez controlled by the corresponding public key hash.

**Note: Contributors to the Tezos Foundation’s fundraiser can get started via the Activate tab**
